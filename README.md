# Goals App
 Udemy course learning project. I try to do myself.
 While doing that, I used "useState", "two-way binding", "Conditional Content Outputting", "Lifting the State Up".
 I created three main components which are "Goal", "Goal List" "Goal Form".
 App stores data as array. Any submission changes the array and see the result on the screen.
Project has two main screens. First screen not allow user input directly. Instead, it opens the form for submission the goal.![Screenshot_432](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51987890/218551966-1bf95ef4-0bf0-42d6-a1ce-f2181828f5bc.png)

After entering the goal, user can press "Add Goal" button for adding the goal. "Cancel" button goes to the first screen.
